White balancing codes for HAYEAR camera software

In our lab, a camera for an Olympus microscope was broken, and I found that a new camera cost about 3M Korean Won (nearly $2000).
So, I bought a new camera from Aliexpress (HAYEAR HY-800B) and adapted it to the microscope. It works nicely, but the white balancing option is incomplete. It is impossible to fix the whited balanced condition.
Thus, I made a white balancing code and manual for the HAYEAR camera software.

This is the camera's spec sheet. It is quite nice, even compared to the original Olympus camera.

Model: HY-800B

Name: USB 2.0 Color 8MP Driver-free UVC Digital Camera

Image Sensor : 1/1.8" Color CMOS Image Sensor

Pixel size: 2μm（H）×2μm(V)

Spectral response: 400nm～1000nm

Scanning method: Progressive scanning, real 8MP image sensor no compression, no interpolation

Resolution: 3840x2160;2592x1944;2560x1440;1920x1080;1280x720;640x480

Image format:

MJPEG (Compression format)

840x2160 @ 25fps; 2592x1944 @ 25fps;

2560x1440 @ 45fps; 1920x1080 @ 60fps;

1280x960 @ 60fps； 1280x720 @ 60fps;

640x480 @ 60fps 320x240 @ 60fps

So, I recommend you use this if you use the HAYEAR camera for microscopy.
